    <h1>
        Oxygene for Java Wire Frame Viewer applet test page</h1>
    <p>
        This page shows the Oxygene for Java Wire Frame Viewer applet running in the browser,
        assuming you have the Java Runtime Environment installed.</p>
    <p>
        Note that the <code>applet</code> tag used to display the applet uses the <code>codebase</code>
        attribute to access the compiled .jar file in the <i>bin\Debug</i> folder. This
        means it expects you to run it from the Debug configuration. If you wish to test
        the release configuration you will need to update the <code>codebase</code> attribute
        to point to the <i>bin\Release</i> folder instead.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
        When deploying your applet, if it resides in the same folder as the web page that
        refers to it then the <code>codebase</code> attribute is not required.</p>
    <p>
        Note also that Java applets have a tendency to be cached. This means that after
        first displaying your applet, any further changes you make to the code and then
        compile to a .jar will likely not be shown when you re-display the applet (for example
        in this test page). To control the cache you can use the Java console. To show the
        Java Console choose the Java option in Control Panel, switch to the Advanced tab,
        expand the Java Console node in the tree of options and select 'Show console'. Whenever
        a Java Platform applet is running the Java Console will now appear and you can press
        X on the keyboard to clear the classloader cache.</p>
    <p>
        Click and drag on the applet to rotate the cube.</p>
