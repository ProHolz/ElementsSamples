<p class="h1"><span>Extension Methods Sample</span></p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p> 	The sample shows how to implement and call custom Extension Methods.</p>


<h2>Examine the code</h2>

<b>Extenson Methods</b> enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.<br>
Defining an extension method is done by applying an <b>[Extension]</b> attribute to a static class and its class method. <br>
This attribute must be defined in the System.Runtime.CompilerServices namespace.<br>
You have several ways to get the <b>Extension Attribute</b> class:
<ul>
<li> If you're sure that .NET 3.5 is installed on the target machine, you can reference the .NET frameworks's System.Core.dll. But remember: You don't need this version of the framework for extension methods.
<li> You can take the System.Core.dll of the Mono framework, which runs on .NET 2.0, too.
<li> You can define it on your own in a seperate assembly. 
</ul>

From <b>Program.pas</b> you can see extended with new methods Integer type and IEnumerable interface.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compile the entire solution.</li> 
<li>Run the application.</li> 
<li>See the results of Extension Methods work.</li>
</ul>
