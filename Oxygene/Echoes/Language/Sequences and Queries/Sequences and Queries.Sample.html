<p class="h1"><span>Sequences and Queries Sample</span></p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p> 	The sample shows features of Oxygene related to sequences and Language Integrated Query (LINQ) statements.</p>


<h2>Examine the code</h2>

<b>Sequences</b> are a special type introduced by the Oxygene language, and can be thought of as a collection of elements, similar to an array. <br>
Examine code (<b>Main.pas</b>) to see how to use different query expressions for retrieving data from sequences.

<ul>
<li> In order to use the <b>Standard Query Operators</b>, is needed reference to the System.Core.dll and the System.Linq namespace 
in your uses clause. <br>
<li> All query expressions are started with a <i>from</i> clause, and can be followed by zero or more additional clauses that act on the sequence. <br> 
</ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compile the entire solution.</li> 
<li>Run the application.</li> 
<li>Try to execute different query statements to see the result in the grid below.</li>
</ul>
