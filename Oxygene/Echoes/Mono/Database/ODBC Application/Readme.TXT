ODBCApplication - 
Console app compiled against .NET assemblies. 
Uses ODBC to run queries against MySQL. 
Works under .NET & Mono on Windows. 
Lack of ODBC elsewhere is an issue. 
ODBC driver available from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc if not installed with MySQL. 
The code assumes driver version 5.1 - if you install a different version just update the connection string accordingly.
